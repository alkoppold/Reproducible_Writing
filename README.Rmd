The goal of Reproducible_Writing is to ...

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

```{r number-two}
2 * 5

with(mtcars, plot(mpg, hp))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
plot(pressure)
warning("Look at me.")
```


```{r slow, cache=TRUE}
# chache = TRUE R speichert die schon gerunnten langsamen Chunks 
slow_square <- function(x){
Sys.sleep(5)
x * x
}
slow_square(4)
```
  

```{r pretty, dev = 'svglite'}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) +
geom_point()
```

install.packages("ragg") #Figure out how to use higher quality pixel graphics with the package: ragg
dev = "ragg_png" # set in the knit chunk options

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
